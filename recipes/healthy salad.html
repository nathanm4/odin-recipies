<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
  <li>1 head red leaf lettuce, torn</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place the almonds and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a small skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir until the sugar melts and the almonds brown, watching carefully to avoid burning.
    Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
  <li>In a large salad bowl, mix
    the lettuce, green onions,
    apple, avocado, dried cranberries,
    blue cheese, and cooked almonds.</li>
  <li>Whisk together the vinegar, 2
    teaspoons of sugar, and salt and
    pepper in a bowl, and stir in the
